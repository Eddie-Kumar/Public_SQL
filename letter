Dear Sunbright Windows Customer Service,
Re: Refund of deposit after cancellation.
As per Consumer Contract Regulation 2013, the contract provides a 14 cooling off period, because we have cancelled contract within that period, a refund of Â£500 (the same amount paid as deposit) has to be provided with in the 14 days, which has to be paid back into my debit card (which was used to make the payment).
Regards,
Eddie Shrivastava
